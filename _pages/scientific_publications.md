Known Problems and some Solutions:

- Exhaustive Evaluation: Current evaluation (i.e., journal/conference reviews) is made by two to four volunteers who may not be experts on the topic. 

- Transparent Evaluation: Current evaluation (i.e., journal/conference reviews) are not published, and the people evaluating is not accountable for their evaluation. This may lead to subjective publication decisions. While having one of the more complicated and relevant roles in the scientific publication cycle, good reviewers (e.g., thorough, detailed, well-argued) are not rewarded. Readers of published papers are unaware of the issues the evaluators found on those.

Evaluation of papers should be an open and continuous process. Readers should be aware of the criticisms, and the level of reliability of the critics.

- Lack of Replicability: Replicability is not a must for publications of results, and papers which try to replicate other's work are not favored for publication.

- Urge for Publication: Scientists are forced to publish several papers per year, regardless of their actual relevance. Research is forced to produce results in the short term.

- Scientific Paper Visibility is Unscientific:
